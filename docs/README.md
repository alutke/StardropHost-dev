### Self-hosted Stardew Valley dedicated server — managed entirely from your browser

*Run a 24/7 Stardew Valley farm your friends can join any time, even when you're offline.*

## What is StardropHost?

StardropHost is a Dockerized Stardew Valley dedicated server with a full browser-based management panel.

Set it up once on a Linux machine or VM. Everything after that — players, saves, mods, settings, logs — is managed from a clean web interface. No SSH, no terminal, no config file editing required.

## Architecture

StardropHost runs as four Docker containers:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  stardrop            Game + SMAPI + Web Panel   │
│  stardrop-manager    Start / Stop / Restart API │
│  stardrop-init       One-shot permission fix    │
│  stardrop-steam-auth Optional: Steam download   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

text| Port      | Purpose                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `18642` | Web management panel                  |
| `24642` | Game server (UDP — open in firewall) |
| `5900`  | VNC (optional, disabled by default)   |

---

## Requirements

- Linux (VM or hardware — Proxmox, bare metal, etc.)
- Docker
- 2 GB RAM minimum · 4 GB recommended for 4+ players
- A copy of Stardew Valley (Steam, GOG, or otherwise... aarrr)

---

## Getting Started

> Not recommended for general use yet. Instructions will be finalised at release.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tomomoto10/StardropHost-dev/main/quick-start.sh | bash
```

bashThen open `http://your-server-ip:18642` and follow the setup wizard.

---

## How Friends Connect

**LAN** — Open Stardew Valley → Co-op → Join LAN Game. The server appears automatically.

**Internet** — Steam invite code support is in development. When complete, a shareable code will appear in the web panel — no port forwarding required.

---

## Uninstall

```bash
cd StardropHost
docker compose down
```

bashThen delete the `StardropHost/` directory. Game saves are stored in `StardropHost/data/saves/` — back these up before deleting if you want to keep them.
